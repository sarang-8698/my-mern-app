# MERN CRUD Application

This is a simple MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application that demonstrates CRUD operations for managing class data. The project includes both a **frontend** built with React and a **backend** built with Node.js and Express, using MongoDB as the database.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Frontend**: React-based UI for CRUD operations.
2. **Backend**: Node.js and Express API to handle requests and connect to the MongoDB database.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Router, React Context
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for the class data.
- **Departments Dropdown**: Fetch departments from the backend or allow users to manually enter their department.
